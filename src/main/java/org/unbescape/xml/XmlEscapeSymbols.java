/**
 * <p>
 *   Instances of this class group all the complex data structures needed to support escape and unescape
 *   operations for XML.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   In contrast with HTML escape operations, the entity references to be used for XML escape/unescape operations
 *   can be defined by the user by manually creating an instance of this class containing all the entities he/she
 *   wants to escape.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   It is <strong>not</strong> recommended to use this XML class for HTML escape/unescape operations. Use the methods
 *   in {@link org.unbescape.html.HtmlEscape} instead, as HTML escape rules include a series of tweaks not allowed in
 *   XML, as well as being less lenient with regard to aspects such as case-sensitivity. Besides, the HTML escape
 *   infrastructure is able to apply a series of performance optimizations not possible in XML due to the fact that
 *   the number of HTML Character Entity References (<em>Named Character References</em> in HTML5 jargon) is fixed
 *   and known in advance.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Objects of this class are <strong>thread-safe</strong>.

     * GLOSSARY
     * ------------------------
     *
     *   ER
     *      XML Entity Reference: references to variables used to define shortcuts to standard text or
     *      special characters. Entity references start with '&' and end with ';'.
     *
     *   CER
     *      Character Entity Reference: XML Entity Reference used to define a shortcut to a specific
     *      character. XML specifies five 'predefined' CERs: &lt; (<), &gt; (>), &amp; (&), &quot; (") and &apos; (').
     *
     *   DCR
     *      Decimal Character Reference: base-10 numerical representation of an Unicode codepoint: &#225;
     *
     *   HCR
     *      Hexadecimal Character Reference: hexadecimal numerical representation of an Unicode codepoint: &#xE1;
     *      Note that XML only allows lower-case 'x' for defining hexadecimal character entity references (in contrast
     *      with HTML, which allows both '&#x...;' and '&#X...;').
     *
     *   Unicode Codepoint
     *      Each of the int values conforming the Unicode code space.
     *      Normally corresponding to a Java char primitive value (codepoint <= \uFFFF),
     *      but might be two chars for codepoints \u10000 to \u10FFFF if the first char is a high
     *      surrogate (\uD800 to \uDBFF) and the second is a low surrogate (\uDC00 to \uDFFF).
     *      See: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/javase/supplementary-142654.html
